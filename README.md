Ferrarello Flickr Justified Customizations
==========================================

I've started using the awesome
[Flickr Justified Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/flickr-justified-gallery/)
for displaying the Flickr photos on my family site,
[ferrarello.com](http://ferrarello.com/).

While this plugin is great because of how the site was setup previously
and the way the data is stored (in post_meta), I wanted to make the
transistion as seamless as possible.

This plugin extends Flickr Justified Gallery to:
- read the existing post_meta (salogic_flickr_list) on the posts for the Flickr set IDs
- read the existing post_meta (salogic_youtube_list) on the posts for the YouTube IDs
- append the YouTube videos to the Flickr Gallery
